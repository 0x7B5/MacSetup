# MacSetup 
Some scripts to help setup my Mac after a restore. Run initial.sh for initial
setup and then apps.sh for installing apps. 

## TO_DO 
- [ ] Change resolution automatically 
- [ ] Install more apps from cli 

## Acknowledgments 
* Erik Boesen for [setup](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/setup), as a lot of the
* code in initial.sh is borrowed from setup.sh.
